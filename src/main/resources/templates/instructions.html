        <p>Spring Boot (Java Web Development):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I used Spring Boot to create my web project.</li>
            <li>I made different classes and interfaces for the "backend" (where the magic happens) and the "MVC" technique (which connects the "frontend" to the "backend").</li>
        </ul>
        <p>HTML (Frontend):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Spring Boot, there's a built-in feature called Thymeleaf for the frontend.</li>
            <li>I used Thymeleaf to create different HTML pages for my website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CSS (Website Styling):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I used CSS to make my website look good and maintain a professional appearance.</li>
            <li>CSS helped me with things like colors, fonts, and layouts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Static Files (Front Page Image):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I stored a single image in the "static" folder to make my front page look attractive.</li>
